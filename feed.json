            "content_html": "<h2>Surgical Repair</h2>\n<p>The bone surrounding the superior canal is one of the few bones in the body that does not repair itself. As such, the dehiscence will never heal by itself.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, some SCDS patients are able to adjust to their symptoms over time. In those cases, it is recommended to keep with symptom management, and have follow-up appointments with an ENT specialist.</p>\n<p>For those that have symptoms that severely impact their quality-of-life, surgery is an option to consider. </p>\n<h3><strong>Finding a Surgeon</strong></h3>\n<p>When considering surgery, it is important to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Surgery to repair SCDS is an invasive, extremely delicate operation.</li>\n<li>Recovery typically takes several weeks or months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As such, it is <strong>critical </strong>to find a specialist surgeon that is very knowledgeable of SCDS, and has a proven record of successful surgeries.</p>\n<h2><strong>Types of Surgery</strong></h2>\n<p>The superior canal is located behind the skull near your ear, and resides underneath the brain's dura (the protective membrane that surrounds the brain). Because of this location, an opening in the skull must be created by the surgeon in order to access the inner ear and repair the dehiscence.</p>\n<p>There are two different types of surgeries used in SCDS operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transmastoid (referred to online as <strong>TM</strong>)</li>\n<li>Middle Fossa Craniotomy (referred to online as <strong style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;\">MFC</strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>TM and MFC have the same types of risks (such as hearing loss), and total recovery time is approximately the same on average.</p>\n<p>Your surgeon will recommend which approach to use based on several factors, including the location of the dehiscence.</p>\n<h4>Transmastoid (TM) Approach</h4>\n<p>TM surgery is performed behind the ear, and is the least-invasive of the two types of surgeries. It can be performed by an ENT surgeon alone, and is typically considered an out-patient day surgery. The downside to the TM approach is that the surgeon has no direct visualization of the dehiscence.</p>\n<h4>Middle Fossa Craniotomy (MFC) Approach</h4>\n<p>MFC surgery is performed by making an opening in the skull above the ear. MFC is a more invasive surgery that requires both an ENT and a neurosurgeon, as the brain dura must be lifted slightly to access the inner ear. However, the MFC approach allows the surgeon to have a complete visualization of the dehiscence. </p>\n<h2><strong>Types of Repairs</strong></h2>\n<p>During the surgery -- whether TM or MFC -- the surgeon will repair the dehiscence using one of several methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plugging</strong> - this is where the surgeon plugs the canal completely, closing the canal. This method helps prevent SCDS symptoms from reoccurring long-term.\n<ul>\n<li>The downside is that this reduces or disables the functionality of that canal, which can cause dizziness and balance issues after surgery. However, the brain typically re-adjusts within several weeks or months, and vestibular rehabilitation therapy can assist with the recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Resurfacing</strong> (sometimes called <strong>Sealing </strong>or <strong>Capping)</strong> - this type of repair attempts to cover the hole caused by the dehiscence without plugging the canal.\n<ul>\n<li>The advantage to this type of repair is that it can help preserve the function of the superior canal by not disabling it, which can reduce post-operative dizziness. However, resurfacing alone has the risk of the repair material being reabsorbed by the body overtime, which could allow the dehiscence to reappear.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In many cases, surgeons will use both methods to ensure the best long-term results.</p>\n<h2>Repair Images</h2>\n<p><br>Plugging of the superior canal:</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/18/plugging-png-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/18/responsive/plugging-png-2-xs.png 300w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/18/responsive/plugging-png-2-sm.png 480w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/18/responsive/plugging-png-2-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Superior canal dehiscence plugging\" width=\"1232\" height=\"506\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Image Artist: <a href=\"https://www.chrisgralapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christine Gralapp</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Resurfacing plus plugging of the superior canal:</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/18/resurfacing-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/18/responsive/resurfacing-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/18/responsive/resurfacing-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/18/responsive/resurfacing-2-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"Superior canal dehiscence resurfacing plus plugging\" width=\"911\" height=\"471\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Image Artist: <a href=\"https://www.chrisgralapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christine Gralapp</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scds.info/surgery-specialists/\" class=\"btn\">Next: Surgical Specialists</a></p>",

Sounds waves travel from the outer ear through to the eardrum in the middle ear, and then finally into the inner ear.<br><br>The inner ear consists of canals (which controls your balance system) and the cochlea (which allows you to hear). </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/1/ear1-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/1/responsive/ear1-2-xs.png 300w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/1/responsive/ear1-2-sm.png 480w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/1/responsive/ear1-2-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Inner Ear Diagram\" width=\"1700\" height=\"1097\">\n<figcaption >Image Artist: <a href=\"https://www.chrisgralapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christine Gralapp</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The <strong>semicircular canals</strong> within the inner ear are three fluid-filled tubes, which are encased in a bone wall.</p>\n<p>When you turn your head, the fluid within the canals moves about, sending signals to your brain about which direction you are turning. These signals are part of the <em>vestibular system</em>, which is how the brain detects and controls our movements and balance.</p>\n<p>If you spin around fast on a merry-go-round or carousel, you will feel dizzy after you have stopped moving because the vestibular system still thinks the body is in motion.</p>\n<h3>What is a Dehiscence?</h3>\n<p>A dehiscence (pronounced <em>de-hi-sense) </em>is a medical term that means \"rupture\" or \"opening\".</p>\n<p>A dehiscence of the superior canal is when an opening or thinning of the bone wall that surrounds the top canal occurs:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/1/ear2-md.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://scds.info/media/posts/1/responsive/ear2-md-xs.png 300w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/1/responsive/ear2-md-sm.png 480w ,https://scds.info/media/posts/1/responsive/ear2-md-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"761\" height=\"679\">\n<figcaption >Image Artist: <a href=\"https://www.chrisgralapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christine Gralapp</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>What causes SCDS?</h3>\n<p>It is suspected that SCDS is congenital - that is, people are born with a thinned bone that surrounds the superior canal. <br><br>The bone can continue to thin as we age, as it is one of the few bones in the body that does not repair itself, and the thinned bone can form a dehiscence naturally over time. In some cases, a dehiscence can also occur due to head trauma. </p>\n<h3>What are the effects of SCDS?</h3>\n<p>A dehiscence can have two primary effects:</p>\n<p><strong>Auditory</strong>: SCDS can cause internal body noises that normally can't be heard (such as your heartbeat, or your own voice) to enter into the inner ear through the dehiscence and reverberate in your ear.</p>\n<p><strong>Vestibular: </strong>SCDS can cause the fluid in the superior canal to dysfunction, causing vestibular issues such as dizziness and imbalance.</p>\n<p>SCDS symptoms are described in more detail in the next page.<br><br><a href=\"https://scds.info/symptoms/\" class=\"btn\">Next: Symptoms</a></p>",
